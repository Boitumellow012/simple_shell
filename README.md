Description:

This project is a simple UNIX command interpreter, commonly referred to as a shell. The shell provides a command-line interface to interact with the operating system, executing various commands and managing processes.

0-betty_would_be_proud.c:This file contains a program that reads integers entered as command-line arguments and prints their sum and product.

1-Simple_shell_0.1: Shell is capable of executing single-word commands without any arguments.

2-Simple_shell_0.2:By adding the capability to handle commands with arguments. The shell can now execute commands with additional parameters.3-Simple_shell_0.3:By incorporating the concept of the PATH. This allows the shell to find and execute commands located in different directories specified in the PATH environment variable.

4-Simple_shell_0.4:Extends the functionality of the shell (0.3) by implementing the "exit" built-in command. Users can now terminate the shell using this built-in command.

5-Simple_shell_1.0:By introducing the "env" built-in command. The "env" command displays the current environment, providing information about the shell's configuration and variables.

Each version of the shell represents a progressive improvement, starting from a basic command-line interpreter that handles simple commands, eventually expanding to support more complex commands with arguments, PATH resolution, and additional built-in functionalities like "exit" and "env."
